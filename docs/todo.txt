To Do for Javascribe: 

Processing bugs/tasks
	When a component modifies a type that wasn't added this run, mark it stale and reprocess.
		Is this necessary?
	Bug: When a processed build is modified by a component, the build must be re-generated.
	Bug: When a component modifies a build that is already processed, the build needs to be reset
		Most likely items in the build's folder should be reset too.

Engine/Processing enhancements:
	Task: Create ContextBase for ProcessorContextImpl and BuildProcessorContextImpl
	There should be an association between a build and its components.
	Add defaultVersion to BuildContext.addDependency(String)
	Task: Support for commands.txt in folders that have build components.
		Support a standing command that runs every time a build in that folder changes.
		Determine other commands to run
	Types should be available on a per-build-context basis instead of on a language basis.
		Maybe they should be available from build context instead of processor context.
		ProcessorContext would then have an API to retrieve another build context.

Pattern bugs/tasks
	Task: Evaluate web service module and web service client patterns to see if there's a better way to associate them.
		Add functionName to endpoint.  Use it to set operationName in WebServiceOperation object
	HTML Template Parser returns a syntax error when template is empty.
	Task: Build more defaults into processors, especially for dependency versions and Maven's Java version.
		Have MavenBuildProcessor default Java to version 17 or 19.
		Output WARN or INFO when using a default.
	Bug?  HTTP Endpoint should read requestParameters as propertyList.
	Task: TableSet should take jdbc parameters as environment variable references.
	Task: Tomcat JNDI Datasource should take JDBC username, password, URL as environment variables.
	Task/Bug: HTTP Endpoint should understand return value properly and understand that the value makes sense in the code execution context.
		Maybe create a code execution context for the endpoint code section in the servlet.
	Task: Convert pattern XML files to use Lombok instead of explicit getters/setters
	Task: Evaluate organization and structure of wsClients XML.  See if it makes sense.
	Task: Analyze Liquibase usage, implement component pattern for it.  Integrate into Maven build.
