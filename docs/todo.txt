x Create domain logic resolver for traversing relationships in the data model.
x Clean-up code and types generated by front end MVVM patterns
x	The page processor should create the page object, view obect and init function.
x	View elements processor should create the properties of the view object.
x	Page Model processor or web service client processor should create model object.
x	Bindings processor should check for existence of view and model before accessing them, to generate valid code.
x	All applicable types should be updated.
Determine if JQuery framework is required (currently only for Ajax calls).
	It would be nice to strip out the JQuery dependency if feasible.
Modify framework to read a directory as well as a zip
x Make some progress on documentation standard
Document remaining patterns.
x Change servlet web service to allow specification of HTTP Method
Change servlet web service to accept a JSON object in the request body.
Change web servlet to accept an object, reading object attributes from parameters.
x Add capability to annotate a data object with Jackson for JSON.
x Modify web service to take parameters that are list of string and list of integer
x Modify controller event to take parameters that are list of string and list of integer.
Access to engine-level resources such as templates should be from EngineProperties.
Access to zip file resources such as templates should be from the ProcessorContext.
Velocity template support.
