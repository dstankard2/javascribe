To Do for Javascribe: 

Processing bugs/tasks
	Bug: When a processed build is modified by a component, the build must be re-generated.
	Bug: When a component modifies a build that is already processed, the build needs to be reset
		Most likely items in the build's folder should be reset too.

Engine/Processing enhancements:
	Remove RuntimePlatform concept in its current form.  Use objects for now.
	Implement logging standard.  Generated code should output errors to log.
	Task: Create ContextBase for ProcessorContextImpl and BuildProcessorContextImpl
	There should be an association between a build and its components.
	Add defaultVersion to BuildContext.addDependency(String)
	Task: Support for commands.txt in folders that have build components.
		Support a standing command that runs every time a build in that folder changes.
		Determine other commands to run
	Types should be available on a per-build-context basis instead of on a language basis.
		Maybe they should be available from build context instead of processor context.
		ProcessorContext would then have an API to retrieve another build context, to get types from another build context.
	Support for profiles, where a profile-specific javascribe.properties file is used

Pattern bugs/tasks
	Bug: Javascript module client needs to read localdatetime properly and/or server needs to send it to client properly.
	Task: Evaluate web service module and web service client patterns to see if there's a better way to associate them.
		Add functionName to endpoint.  Use it to set operationName in WebServiceOperation object
	HTML Template Parser returns a syntax error when template is empty.
	Task: Build more defaults into processors, especially for dependency versions and Maven's Java version.
		Have MavenBuildProcessor default Java to version 17 or 19.
		Output WARN or INFO when using a default.
	Bug?  HTTP Endpoint should read requestParameters as propertyList.
	Task: TableSet should take jdbc parameters as environment variable references.
	Task: Tomcat JNDI Datasource should take JDBC username, password, URL as environment variables.
	Task/Bug: HTTP Endpoint should understand return value properly and understand that the value makes sense in the code execution context.
		Maybe create a code execution context for the endpoint code section in the servlet.
	Task: Convert pattern XML files to use Lombok instead of explicit getters/setters
	Task: Evaluate organization and structure of wsClients XML.  See if it makes sense.
	Task: Analyze Liquibase usage, implement component pattern for it.  Integrate into Maven build.
